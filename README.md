# RISE
Real-time damage assessment of R/C bridges based on an innovative
low-cost acceleration sensing system
<br><br>
<i>The objective of RISE is the development of an innovative low-cost system and software tool to identify the damage state of reinforced concrete bridges in near real-time conditions. The proposed system includes the development of an innovative, low-cost integrated system for the quick assessment of structural damage in existing bridges, based on vibration-based system identification procedures that will include a novel device for recording accelerations on the bridge structure and appropriate software.</i>
